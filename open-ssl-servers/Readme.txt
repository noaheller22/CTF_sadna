# For the openSLL servers we will use nova VE
# Nova's public ip that will be exposed to the player is 132.67.247.151
# Ports:
    * For the error message server we will use port 4433
    * For the timing server we will use port 4434

# Setting up and Running the servers:
    * Go into the folder of the server you want to run. (The updated versions are the folders: Timing-Vulnerability and Error-Message Vulnerability)
       1. Notice that this folder contains the openSSL server as well.
       2. Each folder contains: A skeleton oracle (will be given to the player),the oracle solution and the our server.
       2. In this folder run the server - when on Nova.
       3. On your local PC you can run the skeleton or full oracle -  make sure the port in the script matches the server and you are using Nova's IP.
       4. There is also a clues folder containing different levels of clues.
